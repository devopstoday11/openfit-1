openfit
=======

Open Source sfotware and hardware body and envrionment monitoring software

Description
========
The goal of OpenFit is to provide a way to collect and monitor personal data about a persons body, and then envrionment that it is in. 
The data collected will be provided be open and available to person collecting the data. The device has an on baord SD card, as well as serial interface.
Data can be synchronized via serial or copied off of the removaable SD card.

This software can be repurposed to create health based augmented realitiy gaems. Since it's Open Source hardsare and sofware the can be created
at cost by DIYers, and others.

Software
=========
Open Source software on Github written to follow the Arduino API. Also, goal is to be synable with cloud, or software montioring system.

Hardware
=======
The hardware involved is:
FuabrinoSD: a ChipKit, Arduino compatible prototyping board with built in SD card
Built in SD card
Built in serial port

It will include a GPS, acceleromter:

Optional LCD screen
Optional Magnetometer to find facing

Packaging
==========
Currently, a laser cut box contatins the project

Goals
=======
Form Factor
Price
Monitoring change of time, and generating data that can be easily analysied.


Updates
=====
Should change the Fritzing to Eagle. The needed parts are not all available.
